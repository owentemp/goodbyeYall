#GoodbyeYall Cheap Airfare Finder
http://www.goodbyeyall.com (Hosted on Heroku)

GoodbyeYall is backend-intensive travel app that analyzes flight prices from Texas to 42 of the most popular global destinations with the goals of identifing the least expensive time to fly in the next 12 months and sending Facebook notifications to users based on their individual preferences. :tada::tada:



###Getting Started

###### prerequisites
nodemon has to be installed globally in order for the development server start correctly.

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

###### Development server
Install the dependencies if you have not done it already
```
npm install
```
Then run webpack and have webpack watch for file changes

```
npm run build;          
```

for Windows: 

```
webpack -g
```

In a separate tab in the terminal, start the development server
```
npm run dev
```
Connect to localhost:4000 in your browser


###Built With

- Node JS
- PostgreSQL
- Express
- React JS
- React Router
- React Redux
- React Bootstrap
- D3 JS
- Integrated with Facebook Oauth

In the backend, a worker queries Skyscanner.com's Flights API and filters/formats/stores all the relevant data on our backend using a PostgresSQL database adapter through the Node.js KNEX library.

The front-end accepts user input (travel package selection), and then sends the destination cities as well as preferred Texas airport to the backend.

The backend web server then queries the database for all saved flight quotes and average prices for that route by month retrieved by the worker.

Using this response info, the frontend displays the desirable data in a D3 line chart view, and also generates a 'Buy Now' button offering the cheapest flight available for that route in the next 12 months. Users can toggle between views of each destination within a given travel package and can toggle by preferred origin airport.

Login using Facebook will immiediately redirect to preferances to setup notifications of cheapest routes to the user, notifications are sent via Facebook. Preferances are saved to the database so user may log out when leaving the site.

Travel requirements is rendered in active destination on photo roll view and brings in relevant information for user to prepare for their trip.

D3 data rendering is done by calling data stored from skyscanner API to show user average cost of flights per month.
